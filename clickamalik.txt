### Changes made:
1. Changed `costs` in the *Cardboardbox definition to `cost` for correct syntax.
2. Ensured that comments (if any) are properly indicated using the `//` style to avoid confusion.
3. Minor formatting adjustments for consistency and clarity.

Make sure to replace `https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vecteezy.com%2Fpng%2F46449516-a-cardboard-box-on-a-transparent-background&psig=AOvVaw3KHkDjsQob38N4MmownATF&ust=1745899163235000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBYQjRxqFwoTCID_56zr-YwDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAQ` with the actual URL of the icon you want to use. This should help your game run smoothly! Let me know if you need any further modifications or additions!
